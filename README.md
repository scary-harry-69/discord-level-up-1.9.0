# discord-level-up-1.9.0
Useful for leveling up (for bots) and spamming on the platform known as discord. To clarify this is not mine nor associated with me at all but I couldn't find anyone else on GitHub posting this. Very easy and simple to use, must launch it with the "Bunifu_UI_v1.5.3.dll" file in presence. The ".txt" also known as notepad saved files can be assigned to spam a set of words. If you need help just submit an issue in this repository.
